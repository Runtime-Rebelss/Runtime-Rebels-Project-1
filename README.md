## Git Rules:
- Write commitment messages that says what you do, i.e., "Added new code to Product class".
- Do not push any code to the main branch, use separate branches, i.e., use "shopping-cart" or "product", etc.
- Create your own branches with your changes, then merge when they are confirmed to work.
